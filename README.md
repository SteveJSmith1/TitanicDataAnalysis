Titanic Data Analysis

Given a data set containing information about the passengers of the Titanic and whether or not they survived the disaster, this repository applies data analysis and modelling in an attempt to find factors affecting survival rates and make predictions
about who survived.

This is inspired by the competition **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** on *kaggle.com*
